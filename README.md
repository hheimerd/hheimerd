# About

My name is Konstantin. I'm a programmer with extensive experience in working with many technologies.
I love to create something beautiful, like code or graphics. Every day I learn new features, technologies, or improve my skills.
I like to talk about technology (e.g. new SpaceX robot) and news. Also, I don't forget to take care of my health and do free running
